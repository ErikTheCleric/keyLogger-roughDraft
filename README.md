(9/19/2017) - Launch of the 1st rough draft. Very Barebones and only holds numbers and some special cases
(9/23/2017) - Revision of the KeyLogger. Hides File until the end of the program, also 'closing' the debug window. Is set to turn off the               keylogger when "theList" hits four characters.
